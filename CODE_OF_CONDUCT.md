## 👥 Our Responsibilities

### Community Leaders

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### What Maintainers Will Do

- **Clarify standards** - Explain expectations for behavior

## 🌍 Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- **Communication channels** - Email, Discord, Slack, or other official channels (if created)
- **Social media** - When officially representing the project
- **Public events** - Meetups, conferences, or other gatherings where you represent the project

It also applies when representing the project in public spaces, such as using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative.

## 📋 Enforcement

### Reporting Issues

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

📧 **[conduct@sanitasmind.app](mailto:conduct@sanitasmind.app)**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### What to Include in a Report

When reporting an issue, please provide:

1. **Your contact information** - So we can follow up with you
2. **Description of the incident** - What happened?
3. **When and where it occurred** - Link to the issue/PR/discussion
4. **Who was involved** - GitHub usernames of people involved
5. **Context** - Any additional context that might be helpful

**Confidentiality:** All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Example Report

```markdown
Date: February 15, 2026
Reporter: @username
Location: GitHub Issue #123

Description: User @other-user made dismissive comments about my code 
contribution, suggesting I "learn to code" before contributing. This 
happened after I submitted my first pull request.

Context: This is my first contribution to open source, and while I'm 
learning, the comment was discouraging and violated the Code of Conduct.

Desired Outcome: I'd like the comment to be removed and for the user 
to understand why their behavior was inappropriate.
```

## ⚖️ Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. 📝 Correction

   what happens if the API returns an unexpected response? Maybe we 
   could add validation for that case."

   inline comments with suggestions for improving readability."
```
